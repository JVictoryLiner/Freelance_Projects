Command To Hex and Binary

Develop an application in C++ that can accept an assembly language command and using the Theoretical Processor specification document, translates any valid command entered to Hexadecimal.

  • The application can take a single command at a time, outputting one, two or three bytes (depending on the command)

  • The application should report if the input is invalid • The output does not need any bytes swapped, input should be assumed to be big endian.

Binary To Hex and Command

Either by expanding the functionality of the first application, or by developing a separate application, allow a user to translate Hexadecimal back to assembly language.

  • The application should report if input is invalid or incomplete The output should be in big endian.
